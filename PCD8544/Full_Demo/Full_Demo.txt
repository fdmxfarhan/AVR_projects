The program shows the capabilities of some of the most
important functions of the CodeVisionAVR's graphic library.

The demo is designed to run on Atmel's Xplain ATxmega128A1
development board.
The ATxmega128A1 chip runs from the internal RC oscillator
at 32 MHz.

The 84x48 graphic LCD module (Nokia 3310, 5110 compatible)
is connected to PORTD:
/SCE - PORTD bit 0
/RES - PORTD bit 1
D/C  - PORTD bit 2
SDIN - PORTD bit 3
SCLK - PORTD bit 4

The connections can be modified by accessing the
Project|Configure|C Compiler|Libraries|Graphic LCD menu.

This program exceeds the code size limit of the Evaluation
version of CodeVisionAVR.
In this case you can program the ATxmega128A1 FLASH with
the contents of the
\EXAMPLES\Graphic LCD\PCD8544\Full_Demo\Exe\Full_Demo.hex
file.
